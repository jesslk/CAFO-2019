R. Dzikamunhenga said: I am going to leave this as unpredictable until we have a conversation about what this domain should actually mean (for our purposes). Reading the description from the tool  I have been interpreting this domain as ""Will the result reported less likely be used for meta-analysis  given the issues above?"" I think of publication bias as more of an issue related to design of the study rather than report of the result because the problem was more at how the study was designed i.e. the study was designed to show an effect NOT the study happened to show an effect therefore we should publish that.

Reading the description from the tool  I have been interpreting this domain as ""Will the result reported less likely be used for meta-analysis  given the issues above?"" I think of publication bias as more of an issue related to design of the study rather than report of the result because the problem was more at how the study was designed i.e. the study was designed to show an effect NOT the study happened to show an effect therefore we should publish that.
