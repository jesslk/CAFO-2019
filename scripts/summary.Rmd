# Conclusions

This review revealed that there is sufficient evidence to
conclude that communities living in proximity to goat
production are at increased risk of Q fever. The association
between MRSA colonization and proximity is unclear,
mainly due to a lack of replication. The conclusions
about associations with other outcomes, especially those
related to upper and lower respiratory disease, are unchanged
from the prior review: “There was inconsistent
evidence of a weak association between self-reported disease
in people with allergies or familial history of allergies.
No consistent dose response relationship between exposure
and disease was observable.” If questions about the
health effects of living near animal production continue to
be of interest, then large, long-term prospective studies
will be required, especially if non-specific clinical symptoms
are the outcomes of interest.
